## What is vector addition and scalar multiplication? {.unnumbered}

One of the things you can do with vectors is to add them together. If
you consider vectors have a magnitude and a direction, then graphically,
you would join the head of one vector with the tail of another. While in
i,j,k or vector notation, you sum up each of the components. This yields
an important key to solving vectors problems: Each component can be
considered independent to each other.

This guide will focus on introducing addition and scalar multiplication,
how to calculate them and solve some equations involving vectors.

## Vector Addition

::: callout-note
## Definition of vector addition

For a vector $\vec{a} = \pmatrix{a_1\\a_2}$ and
$\vec{b} = \pmatrix{b_1\\b_2}$, the addition of the two vectors
$\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \pmatrix{a_1 + b_1\\a_2 + b_2}$

In i,j,k notation, if $\vec{a} = a_1 \hat{i} + a_2 \hat{j}$ and
$\vec{b} = b_1 \hat{i} + b_2 \hat{j}$, then
$\vec{a} + \vec{b} = (a_1+b_1) \hat{i} + (a_2 + b_2) \hat{j}$
:::

Graphically, the addition of the vectors is the joining of one head of
the vector to the tail of another.

For subtraction of vectors, inverse
the direction of the vector first before joining them.

You may realize that it is scalar addition done in a component manner.
Thus vector addition inherits properties from scalar addition as well.

## Properties of vector addition

-   $\vec{u} + \vec{v} = \vec{v} + \vec{u}$

-   $(\vec{u} + \vec{v}) + \vec{w} = \vec{u} + (\vec{v} + \vec{w})$

::: callout-warning
As vector addition is similar to scalar addition, then the rules for
expanding brackets follow.

$\vec{u} - \vec{v} + \vec{w} \neq\vec{u} - (\vec{v} + \vec{w})$
:::

## The Zero vector

The zero vector $\vec{0}$ is defined as a vector with zero length. This
is different from the 0 scalar.

::: callout-note
## Definition of the zero vector

To represent the zero vector in column, $\vec{0} = \pmatrix{0\\0\\0}$ In
i.j.k form, $\vec{0} = 0\hat{i} + 0\hat{j} + 0\hat{k}$.
:::

The representation depends on the number of dimensions the vector.

The zero vector has the following properties:

-   $\vec{0} + \vec{u} = \vec{u}$

-   $\vec{u} + (-\vec{u}) = \vec{0}$

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 1

You are given $\vec{a} = \pmatrix{3\\4}$ and $\vec{b} = \pmatrix{5\\6}$.
Then $\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \pmatrix{3+5\\4+6} = \pmatrix{8\\10}$
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 2

You are given $\vec{a} = 3\hat{i} + 4\hat{j}$ and
$\vec{b} = -5\hat{i} - 6\hat{j}$. Then
$\vec{a} + \vec{b} =(3-5)\hat{i} + (4-6)\hat{j} = -2\hat{i} -2\hat{j}$
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 3

You are given $\vec{a} = 3\hat{i} + 4\hat{j}$ and
$\vec{b} = 2\hat{i} +8\hat{j} + 12\hat{k}$. Then
$\vec{a} + \vec{b} =(3+2)\hat{i} + (4+8)\hat{j} + (0 + 12)\hat{k} = 5\hat{i} + 12\hat{j} + 12\hat{k}$
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 4

You are given $\vec{a} = \pmatrix{2\\1\\0}$,
$\vec{b} = \pmatrix{7\\2\\1}$ and $\vec{c} = \pmatrix{-3\\-2\\5}.$ Then
$\vec{a} + \vec{b} - \vec{c} = \pmatrix{2+7 - (-3)\\1+2-(-2)\\0 + 1 + 5} = \pmatrix{12\\5\\6}$
:::

## Scalar multiplication

::: callout-note
## Definition of scalar multiplication

Given a vector $\vec{a}$ and a scalar $\lambda$, then $\lambda \vec{a}$
is a vector that has the same direction as $\vec{a}$ but with its length
multiplied by $\lambda$. If $\lambda < 0$, then the direction of
$\vec{a}$ is reversed.

In column notation, if $\vec{a} = \pmatrix{a_1\\a_2}$, then
$\lambda \vec{a} = \pmatrix{\lambda a_1\\ \lambda a_2}$

In i,j,k notation, if $\vec{a} = a_1\hat{i} + a_2\hat{j}$, then
$\lambda \vec{a} = \lambda a_1\hat{i} + \lambda a_2\hat{j}$

## Properties of scalar multiplication

Since vector addition is similar to component-wise multiplication, then
it has the following properties for scalars $\lambda$ and $\mu$:

-   $\lambda \mu \vec{a} = \lambda (\mu \vec{a})$

-   $( \lambda + \mu ) \vec{a} = \lambda \vec{a} + \mu \vec{a}$

-   $\lambda (\vec{a} + \vec{b}) = \lambda\vec{a} + \lambda\vec{b}$

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 6

You are given $\vec{a} = \pmatrix{3\\5\\6}$. Then
$5\vec{a} = \pmatrix{5\times3\\5\times5\\5\times6} = \pmatrix{15\\25\\30}$
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 7

You are given $\vec{b} = -2\hat{i} + 6\hat{j} - 7\hat{k}$. Then
$\vec{b} \times -3 = (-3)(-2)\hat{i} + (-3)6\hat{j} - (-3)7\hat{k} = 6\hat{i} -18\hat{j} + 21\hat{k}$
:::

## Solving vector equations.

By combining addition and scalar multiplication, you can form vector
equations. A property of vector equations is that the magnitudes of each
component must be equal.

::: callout-note
## Solving vector equations

If $\lambda \vec{a} + \mu \vec{b} = \vec{c}$

Then in i,j,k notation,
$\vec{a} = a_1\hat{i} + a_2\hat{j}$,$\vec{b} = b_1\hat{i} + b_2\hat{j}$
and $\vec{c} = c_1\hat{i} + c_2\hat{j}$.

The equation gives
$\lambda(a_1\hat{i} + a_2\hat{j} )+ \mu(b_1\hat{i} + b_2\hat{j}) = c_1\hat{i} + c_2\hat{j}$

In column notation,

$\vec{a} = \pmatrix{a_1\\a_2}$, $\vec{b} = \pmatrix{b_1\\b_2}$ and
$\vec{c} = \pmatrix{c_1\\c_2}$.

The equation gives
$\pmatrix{\lambda a_1 + \mu b_1\\ \lambda a_2 + \mu b_2} = \pmatrix{c_1\\c_2}$

Both notations give the same simultaneous equations:

$\begin{cases}\lambda a_1 + \mu b_1 = c_1\\\lambda a_2 + \mu b_2 = c_2\end{cases}$
:::

If we have some general vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$,then if
$\vec{u} = \lambda \vec{v}$, the two vectors must be parallel to each
other.

<!-- This part is the quick examples for simultaneous equations -->

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 8

If the coordinates of B are $\pmatrix{-5,-2,-4}$ and
$\vec{AB} = \hat{i} + \hat{j} - 6\vec{k}$, then you can find the
coordinates of A by solving the equation

$\vec{AB} = \vec{OB} - \vec{OA}$.

Let $A = \pmatrix{a_1\\a_2\\a_3}$

$\pmatrix{1\\1\\-6} = \pmatrix{-5\\-2\\-4} - \pmatrix{a_1\\a_2\\a_3}$,
which gives the simultaneous equations

$\begin{cases}1 = -5 - a_1 \\1 = -2-a_2 \\ -6 = -4 - a_3\end{cases}$

Solving the equation gives $a_1 = -6$, $a_2 = -3$ and $a_3 = 2$. So
$A = \pmatrix{-6\\-3\\2}$
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 9

If $\vec{u} = 4\hat{i} + 3\hat{j}$ and $\vec{v} = -\hat{i} + 2\hat{j}$,
you can express $7\hat{i} + 19\hat{j}$ in terms of $\vec{u}$ and
$\vec{v}$ by solving
$7\hat{i} + 19 \hat{j} = \lambda \vec{u} + \mu \vec{v} = (4\lambda \hat{i} + 3\lambda\hat{j}) + (-\mu\hat{i} + 2\mu\hat{j})$

$7\hat{i} + 19 \hat{j} = (4\lambda - \mu)\hat{i} + (3\lambda + 2\mu) \hat{j}$,
which gives the simultaneous equations

$\begin{cases} 7 = 4\lambda - \mu \dots(1) \\ 19 = 3\lambda + 2\mu\dots(2)\end{cases}$
Solving the equation gives $\lambda = 3$ , $\mu = 5$

$8\hat{i} + 9\hat{j} = 3\vec{u} + 5\vec{v}$
