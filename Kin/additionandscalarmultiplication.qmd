## What is vector addition and scalar multiplication? {.unnumbered}

Vectors have a magnitude and a direction and are represented in coordinate spaces by components. These components can be considered independent to each other. As a result, when you add two vectors together or multiply a vector by a scalar, you have to consider each component of the vector individually.

This guide will focus on introducing addition and scalar multiplication, for vectors in both i,j,k and column notation, and explaining the role of addition and scalar multiplication in solving simple equations using vectors.


## Vector Addition

::: callout-note
## Definition of vector addition

Let $\vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix}a_1\\a_2\end{pmatrix}$ and
$\vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix}b_1\\b_2\end{pmatrix}$, the addition of the two vectors, denoted $\vec{a} + \vec{b}$, is defined as follows: 
$\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix}a_1 + b_1\\a_2 + b_2\end{pmatrix}$.

In $i$,$j$,$k$ notation, where $\vec{a} = a_1 \hat{i} + a_2 \hat{j}$ and
$\vec{b} = b_1 \hat{i} + b_2 \hat{j}$, the addition of the two vectors is defined as:
$\vec{a} + \vec{b} = (a_1+b_1) \hat{i} + (a_2 + b_2) \hat{j}$.

## The geometric interpretation of vector addition
You can also interpret vector addition geometrically, where the addition of vectors is the joining of one head of
the vector to the tail of another.

For subtraction of vectors, inverse
the direction of the vector first before joining them.

You may realize that it is scalar addition done in a component manner, that is you sum of the magnitude of the $i$th component, the $j$th component and the $k$th component independently.
Thus vector addition inherits properties from scalar addition as well.

## Properties of vector addition

-   $\vec{u} + \vec{v} = \vec{v} + \vec{u}$

-   $(\vec{u} + \vec{v}) + \vec{w} = \vec{u} + (\vec{v} + \vec{w})$

::: callout-warning
As vector addition is similar to scalar addition, then the rules for
expanding brackets follow.

$\vec{u} - \vec{v} + \vec{w} \neq\vec{u} - (\vec{v} + \vec{w})$
:::

## The Zero vector

The zero vector $\vec{0}$ is defined as a vector with zero length. This
is different from the 0 scalar.

::: callout-note
## Definition of the zero vector

To represent the zero vector in column notation, $\vec{0} = \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}$. In
$i$,$j$,$k$ form, $\vec{0} = 0\hat{i} + 0\hat{j} + 0\hat{k}$.
:::

The zero vector can have any number of components, and the magnitude of all of those components are zero.

The zero vector has the following properties:

-   $\vec{0} + \vec{u} = \vec{u}$

-   $\vec{u} + (-\vec{u}) = \vec{0}$

## Example 1

You are given $\vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix}3\\4\end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix}5\\6\end{pmatrix}$.
Then $\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix}3+5\\4+6\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}8\\10\end{pmatrix}$
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 2

You are given $\vec{a} = 3\hat{i} + 4\hat{j}$ and
$\vec{b} = -5\hat{i} - 6\hat{j}$. Then
$\vec{a} + \vec{b} =(3-5)\hat{i} + (4-6)\hat{j} = -2\hat{i} -2\hat{j}$
:::

## Example 3

You are given $\vec{a} = 3\hat{i} + 4\hat{j}$ and
$\vec{b} = 2\hat{i} +8\hat{j} + 12\hat{k}$. Then
$\vec{a} + \vec{b} =(3+2)\hat{i} + (4+8)\hat{j} + (0 + 12)\hat{k} = 5\hat{i} + 12\hat{j} + 12\hat{k}$

$\vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix}7\\2\\1\end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{c} = \begin{pmatrix}-3\\-2\\5\end{pmatrix}.$ Then
$\vec{a} + \vec{b} - \vec{c} = \begin{pmatrix}2+7 - (-3)\\1+2-(-2)\\0 + 1 - 5\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}12\\5\\-4\end{pmatrix}$

## Example 5

You are given $\vec{a}= \begin{pmatrix} 2\\\lambda\end{pmatrix}$. Then $\vec{a} + \vec{0} = \begin{pmatrix} 2+0\\\lambda+0\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2\\\lambda\end{pmatrix}$.
:::

## Scalar multiplication

::: callout-note
## Definition of scalar multiplication

Given a vector $\vec{a}$ and a scalar $\lambda$, then $\lambda \vec{a}$
is a vector that has the same direction as $\vec{a}$ but with its length
multiplied by $\lambda$. If $\lambda < 0$, then the direction of
$\vec{a}$ is reversed.

In column notation, if $\vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix}a_1\\a_2\end{pmatrix}$, then
$\lambda \vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix}\lambda a_1\\ \lambda a_2\end{pmatrix}$

In i,j,k notation, if $\vec{a} = a_1\hat{i} + a_2\hat{j}$, then
$\lambda \vec{a} = \lambda a_1\hat{i} + \lambda a_2\hat{j}$

## Properties of scalar multiplication

Since vector addition is similar to component-wise multiplication, then
it has the following properties for scalars $\lambda$ and $\mu$:

-   $\lambda \mu \vec{a} = \lambda (\mu \vec{a})$

-   $( \lambda + \mu ) \vec{a} = \lambda \vec{a} + \mu \vec{a}$

-   $\lambda (\vec{a} + \vec{b}) = \lambda\vec{a} + \lambda\vec{b}$

## Example 6

You are given $\vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix}3\\5\\6\end{pmatrix}$. Then
$5\vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix}5\times3\\5\times5\\5\times 6\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}15\\25\\30\end{pmatrix}$
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 7

You are given $\vec{b} = -2\hat{i} + 6\hat{j} - 7\hat{k}$. Then
$\vec{b} \times -3 = (-3)(-2)\hat{i} + (-3)6\hat{j} - (-3)7\hat{k} = 6\hat{i} -18\hat{j} + 21\hat{k}$
:::

## Solving vector equations

By combining addition and scalar multiplication, you can form vector
equations. A property of vectors is that they are only equal if and only if their components are individually equal. You can use this to solve vector equations.

::: callout-note
## Solving vector equations

If $\lambda \vec{a} + \mu \vec{b} = \vec{c}$

Then in $i$,$j$,$k$ notation,

let $\vec{a} = a_1\hat{i} + a_2\hat{j}$,$\vec{b} = b_1\hat{i} + b_2\hat{j}$
and $\vec{c} = c_1\hat{i} + c_2\hat{j}$.

The equation gives

$\lambda(a_1\hat{i} + a_2\hat{j} )+ \mu(b_1\hat{i} + b_2\hat{j}) = c_1\hat{i} + c_2\hat{j}$

In column notation,

$\vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix}a_1\\a_2\end{pmatrix}$, $\vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix}b_1\\b_2\end{pmatrix}$ and
$\vec{c} = \begin{pmatrix}c_1\\c_2\end{pmatrix}$.

The equation gives
$\begin{pmatrix}\lambda a_1 + \mu b_1\\ \lambda a_2 + \mu b_2\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}c_1\\c_2\end{pmatrix}$

Both notations give the same simultaneous equations:

$\begin{cases}\lambda a_1 + \mu b_1 = c_1\\\lambda a_2 + \mu b_2 = c_2\end{cases}$
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
If we have some general vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$,then if
$\vec{u} = \lambda \vec{v}$, the two vectors must be **parallel** to each
other. If the vectors are parallel to each other, but they point in opposite directions, they are **anti-parallel** to each other.

<!-- This part is the quick examples for simultaneous equations -->

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 8

If the coordinates of B are $\begin{pmatrix}-5,-2,-4\end{pmatrix}$ and
$\vec{AB} = \hat{i} + \hat{j} - 6\vec{k}$, then you can find the
coordinates of A by solving the equation

$\vec{AB} = \vec{OB} - \vec{OA}$.

Let $A = \begin{pmatrix}a_1\\a_2\\a_3\end{pmatrix}$

$\begin{pmatrix}1\\1\\-6\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}-5\\-2\\-4\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}a_1\\a_2\\a_3\end{pmatrix}$,
which gives the simultaneous equations

$\begin{cases}1 = -5 - a_1 \\1 = -2-a_2 \\ -6 = -4 - a_3\end{cases}$

Solving the equation gives $a_1 = -6$, $a_2 = -3$ and $a_3 = 2$. So
$A = \begin{pmatrix}-6\\-3\\2\end{pmatrix}$
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 9

If $\vec{u} = 4\hat{i} + 3\hat{j}$ and $\vec{v} = -\hat{i} + 2\hat{j}$,
you can express $7\hat{i} + 19\hat{j}$ in terms of $\vec{u}$ and
$\vec{v}$ by solving
$7\hat{i} + 19 \hat{j} = \lambda \vec{u} + \mu \vec{v} = (4\lambda \hat{i} + 3\lambda\hat{j}) + (-\mu\hat{i} + 2\mu\hat{j})$

$7\hat{i} + 19 \hat{j} = (4\lambda - \mu)\hat{i} + (3\lambda + 2\mu) \hat{j}$,
which gives the simultaneous equations

$\begin{cases} 7 = 4\lambda - \mu \dots(1) \\ 19 = 3\lambda + 2\mu\dots(2)\end{cases}$
Solving the equation gives $\lambda = 3$ , $\mu = 5$

$8\hat{i} + 9\hat{j} = 3\vec{u} + 5\vec{v}$
