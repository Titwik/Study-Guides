## What are Logarithms?

In the same way that subtraction 'undoes' addition, and division 'undoes' multiplication, you can think of the logarithm as the function that 'undoes' exponentiation. Logarithms are useful because they essentially let you work backwards through a calculation by undoing exponential effects. Furthermore, logarithms allow us to express large numbers in a convenient way, as well as model various phenomena as they occur in a logarithmic fashion. An example would be a hot object cooling down; this decays logarithmically.

In this guide, we will go over the definition of a logarithm, the laws concerning logarithms, what the natural logarithm is and finally, how to change the base of a logarithm.

## Definition of a Logarithm

In its simplest form, a logarithm answers "How many of one number multiply together to make another number." This is what motivates the following definition:

$$ a^x = b$$ or

$$log_a(b) = x $$ where $x$ is the *exponent*, $a$ is the *base* and $b$ is the *argument*. You would read the equation above as "logarithm of $b$ to the base $a$ is equal to $x$."

## Example 1

Suppose you are given the equation $log_{10}(1000) = x$, and you need to find $x$. You can rewrite the equation as $2^x = 8$, and from here, you can see that $x = 3$.

## Example 2

Now consider the equation $log_x(8) = 3$. Rewriting this, you can see that this is equal to $x^3 = 8$. Thus, $x = 2$.

Generally, if the base is not specified, it is assumed that the base is 10. So for example, $log(a) = b$ means that the logarithm of $a$ to the base $10$ is equal to $b$.

## Example 3

Consider the equation from [Example 1](#example-1-link). This can be rewritten as $log(1000) = x$, and the solution for $x$ is once again $x = 3$

## Laws of Logarithms

There are several rules of logarithms that allows us to expand, condense and solve logarithmic equations. There are 7 of them, and they are as follows:

::: callout-note
## Law 1: Product Rule

$$log(M \cdot N) = log(M) + log(N)$$ 
The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors.

For example:

$$log(100) = log(10 \cdot 10) = log(10) + log(10)$$
:::

## Law 2: Quotient Rule

$$log(\frac{M}{N}) = log(M) - log(N) $$ 
The logarithm of a ratio of two numbers is equal to the logarithm of the **numerator** minus the logarithm of the **denominator**

For example:

$$log(\frac{5}{4}) = log(5) - log(4)$$
:::

## Law 3: Power Rule

$$log(M^k) = k \cdot log(M)$$ 
The logarithm of an exponential number is the exponent multiplied with the logarithm of the base.

For example:

$$log(4) = log(2^2) = 2 \cdot log(2)$$
:::

## Law 4: Zero Rule

$$log_b(1) = 0$$
The logarithm of 1 to any base is **always** equal to 0.

:::

::: callout-note
## Law 5: Identity Rule

$$log_b(b) = 1$$

The logarithm of the argument, where the argument is the base of the logarith, is **always** equal to 1.

:::

## Law 6: Inverse of a logarithm

$$log_b(b^k) = k$$
The logarithm of an exponential where the base is equal to the base of the logarithm is equal to the exponent.

:::

::: callout-note
## Law 7: Inverse of an exponent

$$b^{log_b(k)} = k$$
Raising a logarithm of a number to its own base is equal to the number itself.
