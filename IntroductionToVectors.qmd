## Introduction {-}

In mathematics, physics, engineering and technology, you will come across two types of quantities, scalar quantities such as length, mass, time, distance, density, area, volume, temperature, work, etc. and vector quantities like position, displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, momentum, etc.

Vectors has various real-life applications across different fields, such as Engineering, Navigation and GPS, Computer Graphics and Gaming, Data Analysis and Machine learning, Cryptography and much more. In this guide, you will study some of the fundamental concepts about vectors, various operations on vectors, and their algebraic and geometric properties.

## Definition of Scalars and Vectors

**Scalars**: Any physical quantity that has magnitude only and no direction are called scalar quantities. They are represented by a single real number along with appropriate units of measurement. They can be positive, negative or zero. 

**Vectors**: Any physical quantity that has both magnitude and direction is called a vector quantity. Besides this, a physical quantity, which is a vector, should also follow laws of vector addition. For example, electric current has both magnitude and direction, but it doesnâ€™t follow laws of vector addition and hence is not a vector. (you will see this in the next chapter)

## Example 1.1 
In classifying $15kg$, $45m/s^2$ and $70W$ as either a scalar or vector quantity, $15kg$ and $70W$ are scalar quantities because mass and power don't have direction, whereas, $45m/s^2$ is a vector quantity because accelaration needs direction.

## Representation Of Vectors{-}
Consider a line AB in space and let a direction be assigned to it. The arrow marked on the line denotes the direction of the vector. Vectors are written with a little arrow over its head, for example, $\vec{AB}$. 

The direction in which the arrow points towards is called the head of a vector, which makes the other end, the tail of the vector. The length of the line indicates the magnitude of the vector and is denoted by $|\vec{AB}|$.

![Figure 1.1 shows the vector  $\vec{AB}$  whereas the Figure 1.2 shows the vector  $\vec{BA}$.]

## Example 1.2

A car A travels from point P to point Q with a velocity of $80 km/hr$. Simultaneously, a car B starts travelling from point Q to point P with the same velocity. In this case,  $\vec{PQ}=80km/hr$ for car A and $\vec{QP}=80km/hr$ for car B.

## Example 1.3

Continuing the Example 1.2, consider the car B to be travelling in the same direction as car A but with half the velocity. Visually, the velocity vector would also become half for the second car.

## Vectors In Three-Dimensional Space{-}
A vector $\vec{a}$ can be expressed in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space through various coordinate systems. You will see the standard cartesian coordinate system in this guide.

##### Position Vectors

Consider a point B in space, having coordinates (x,y,z) with respect  to the origin O(0,0,0). Then, the vector $\vec{OP}$ is the position vector for the point P.The magnitude of $\vec{OP}$ is given by 

$|\vec{OP}|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$

## Different types of vectors{-}

- **Zero or Null Vector**: A vector $\vec{a}$ is said to be a zero or a null vector if its magnitude is zero. For example, a stationary body has the velocity vector as zero. 

- **Collinear vectors**: A vector is said to be collinear if it is coincident with the given vector, i.e., they have the same direction but need not have the same magnitude. 

- **Negative of A Vector**: A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of the given vector $\vec{a}$ but is in the opposite direction is called the negative of a vector and is denoted by -$\vec{a}$. These are also collinear vectors.

## Example 1.4

When a ball is dropped from a height, gravity acts in the same direction as the motion of the ball, hence, the gravitational force $\vec{g}=10m/s^2$. A negative gravitational force would mean that gravity is working in the opposite direction of the motion, which is the case of a vertically projected body, here, $-\vec{g}$ is applied.
